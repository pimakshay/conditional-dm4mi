# Research Context and Methodology

This document provides detailed information about the research context, methodology, and findings of the Conditional Diffusion Models for Medical Imaging (CDM4MI) project.

## Research Background

### Collaboration
This project was conducted as a research collaboration between:
- **GE Healthcare**: Industry partner providing domain expertise and medical imaging data
- **Technical University of Munich (TUM)**: Academic institution providing research framework and computational resources

### Research Objectives

The primary research objectives were to:

1. **Understand Diffusion Model Behavior** in medical imaging contexts
2. **Evaluate Conditioning Strategies** for image denoising tasks
3. **Compare Performance** against traditional denoising methods
4. **Analyze Noise Level Sensitivity** and optimal operating ranges
5. **Investigate Guidance Mechanisms** for improved denoising quality

## Methodology

### 1. Problem Formulation

#### Medical Image Denoising
The denoising problem is formulated as:
- **Input**: Noisy medical image (CT/MR)
- **Output**: Clean, denoised medical image
- **Objective**: Minimize reconstruction error while preserving anatomical details

#### Conditional Diffusion Process
The conditional DDPM process involves:
1. **Forward Process**: Adding noise to clean images over T timesteps
2. **Reverse Process**: Learning to denoise conditioned on noisy input
3. **Conditioning**: Using noisy image as conditioning information

### 2. Model Architecture

#### Conditional DDPM
The model extends standard DDPM with conditioning:

```python
# Forward process: q(x_t | x_{t-1})
x_t = sqrt(α_t) * x_{t-1} + sqrt(1-α_t) * ε

# Reverse process: p_θ(x_{t-1} | x_t, c)
x_{t-1} = μ_θ(x_t, t, c) + σ_t * z
```

Where:
- `x_t`: Noisy image at timestep t
- `c`: Conditioning image (noisy input)
- `ε`: Gaussian noise
- `μ_θ`: Learned denoising function

#### Conditioning Strategy
**Concatenation-based Conditioning**:
- Input: `[noisy_image, conditioning_image]`
- Method: Channel-wise concatenation
- Advantage: Simple, effective, computationally efficient

### 3. Experimental Setup

#### Datasets
- **CT Images**: Brain CT scans from multiple patients
- **MR Images**: Brain MR scans from IXI dataset
- **Image Size**: 64×64 pixels (configurable)
- **Preprocessing**: Normalization to [-1, 1] range

#### Noise Types
- **Gaussian Noise**: Primary noise type for evaluation
- **Variance Levels**: 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2
- **Noise Addition**: Applied during training data generation

#### Baseline Methods
1. **Non-Local Means (NLM)**: Traditional denoising method
2. **U-Net**: Deep learning baseline
3. **Standard DDPM**: Unconditional diffusion model

### 4. Training Protocol

#### Training Configuration
- **Optimizer**: AdamW with learning rate 2e-6
- **Batch Size**: 16 (configurable)
- **Timesteps**: 1000 diffusion steps
- **Loss Function**: L2 loss (MSE)
- **Training Steps**: 50,000 maximum

#### Data Augmentation
- **Noise Injection**: Gaussian noise with varying variance
- **Spatial Augmentation**: Random cropping and flipping
- **Intensity Augmentation**: Contrast and brightness adjustment

### 5. Evaluation Metrics

#### Quantitative Metrics
1. **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**:
   ```
   PSNR = 20 * log10(MAX_I / sqrt(MSE))
   ```

2. **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**:
   ```
   SSIM = (2μ_xμ_y + c1)(2σ_xy + c2) / (μ_x² + μ_y² + c1)(σ_x² + σ_y² + c2)
   ```

3. **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**:
   ```
   MAE = (1/N) * Σ|y_true - y_pred|
   ```

#### Qualitative Assessment
- **Visual Inspection**: Side-by-side comparison
- **Anatomical Preservation**: Assessment by medical experts
- **Artifact Detection**: Identification of reconstruction artifacts

## Key Findings
